# Intern-Arc
An Internship Management System developed for the main 2nd year project at University (UCSC).

A fully functional web application to automate the industry placement process of UCSC university undergraduates without using any framework. We built the core of our project based on MVC architecture using PHP, vanilla JavaScript, MYSQL, HTML, and CSS. Take a peek!

- Uploading student CVs and showcasing their qualifications on a profile.
- View and apply to advertisements added by companies
- Scheduling interviews
- Notifications throughout the whole process
- Submit and review complaints
- Generate reports summarizing statistics of the industry placement process of each year.
