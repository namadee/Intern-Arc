# Intern-Arc
An Internship Management System developed for the main 2nd year project at University (UCSC).

A fully functional web application to automate the industry placement process of UCSC university undergraduates without using any framework. We built the core of our project based on MVC architecture using PHP, vanilla JavaScript, MYSQL, HTML and CSS. Take a peek!
